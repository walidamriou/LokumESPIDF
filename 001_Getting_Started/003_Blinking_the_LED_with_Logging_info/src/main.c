/*
The RTOS tick?
The RTOS tick is a fixed interval periodic interrupt generated form a hardware timer.
It is used to measure real time.   The resolution of time that can be measured is 
dependent on the tick period. For example, if the RTOS tick frequency is set to 1ms 
then time can be measured with an accuracy of 1ms  but there is also an overhead of 
having an interrupt every 1ms.
